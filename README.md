# Objective

The objective of this project is simulate a differential wheeled robot 
covering a given path using MATLAB.

# How to run

- This project includes 2 models of a differential wheeled robot.
- The models were built following an OOP concept, therefore there are
two class definitions - Robot.m and IncrementalRobot.m - which contains
each robot's properties and methods.
- The simulation routine is started by one of the following files, each
corresponding to its respective class definition
    - differentialModel.m
    - incrementalDifferentialModel.m
